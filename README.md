# To-Do App (React + Spring Boot + MySQL) â€” Dockerized

A small full-stack To-Do application:

- Frontend: React (Vite) served by Nginx

- Backend: Spring Boot (Java 17)

- DB: MySQL 8

- Orchestration: Docker Compose

The app is wired so the frontend talks to the backend via the same origin (/api), which works consistently on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## 1) Prerequisites

- Docker 20+

- Docker Compose v2 

## 2) One-command run

From the project root (where docker-compose.yml lives):

`docker compose up -d --build`

This builds the images and starts all services.

### Open the app

- Frontend: http://localhost

(You should see the To-Do UI. Add tasks on the left; they appear on the right.)

If your compose publishes a different port (e.g., 3000), use that: http://localhost:3000

## 3) API quick check (optional)

After the stack is up, you can exercise the API directly:

#### Create a task
`curl -X POST http://localhost/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Read books","description":"Need to cover the syllabus"}'`

#### List tasks
`curl http://localhost/api/tasks`

If the frontend publishes on port 3000, use http://localhost:3000/api/....

## 4) Useful commands

#### View logs (follow all services)
docker compose logs -f

#### View only backend logs
docker compose logs -f backend

#### Stop containers (keep data volumes)
docker compose down

#### Stop and remove containers + volumes (fresh start)
docker compose down -v
